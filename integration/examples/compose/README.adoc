=== Example: Running skaffold with docker-compose files
:icons: font

This example provides a simple application set up to run with 
https://docs.docker.com/compose/[docker-compose].
Notice there is no skaffold configuration present: to run this example,
first run `skaffold init --compose-file docker-compose.yaml`, which will
invoke the https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose[kompose] binary to generate
kubernetes manifests based off of the docker-compose configuration, and then run
`skaffold init` to generate the skaffold configuration.
