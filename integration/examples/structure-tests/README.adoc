=== Example: Running container-structure-test on built images
:icons: font

This example shows how to run
https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test[structure tests]
on newly built images in your skaffold dev loop. Tests are associated with single
artifacts, and one or more test files can be provided. Tests are configured in
your `skaffold.yaml` in the `test` stanza, e.g.

[source,yaml]
----
test:
    - image: gcr.io/k8s-skaffold/skaffold-example
    structureTests:
        - ./test/*
----

Tests can also be configured through profiles, e.g.

[source,yaml]
----
profiles:
  - name: test
    test:
      - image: gcr.io/k8s-skaffold/skaffold-example
        structureTests:
          - ./test/profile_structure_test.yaml
